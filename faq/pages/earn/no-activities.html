            In general, new activities are available every day, at least one activity a day. Since we are at the very
            early stages of the app, you may occasionally see a notice that your next activity will be available on a
            date later than the next day. <br /><br /> Please notice! We sometimes require you to upgrade to the latest
            Kinit version in order to receive your next activity. Should that happen, you will receive a push
            notification requiring you to upgrade. Another reason for not getting activities is if you created another
            Kinit account on a different device using your phone number to complete the phone verification step. In
            this case your previous account is automatically deactivated and no new activities will be available on
            this account.<br /><br />If you experience 2 or more days without any new activity, without an indication
            about when the next activity will be available or a push notification requiring you to upgrade and you
            haven't used the same phone number to register on a different device, please contact us and we will
            investigate and get back to you.
