      <p class="text">In case you’ve noticed an unexpected change in your balance or missing some / all of your Kin, there are a few possible reasons:<br/>1.Server issues: check your balance again after 1-2 days.<br/>2. You created a new account and didn’t restore your previous Kin. If you’ve backed up your account, uninstalled it and reinstalled it, the app will recognize you are a returning user (if you use the same phone number) and will suggest you restore/recover your Kin.<br/>3. You tried to purchase a gift card, unsuccessfully. However, the app charged you for it. Please go to the gift cards FAQ to see next steps.<br/>4. You completed an earning activity but didn’t get the reward yet. If you didn’t get an error message when completing the activity, try to close the app and relaunch it. <br/><br/>If neither of these options worked, please reach out to us so we can investigate this further.</p>
