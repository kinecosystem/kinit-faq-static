      <p class="text">In general, new activities are available every day, at least one activity a day. However, you may occasionally see a notice that your next activity will be available on a date later than the next day.<br/><br/>Please notice! We sometimes require you to upgrade to the latest Kinit version in order for you to receive your next activity. Should that happen, you will receive a push notification and/or an in-app message requiring you to upgrade.<br/>Another reason for not getting activities is if you created another Kinit account on a different device using your phone number to complete the phone verification step. In this case, your previous account is automatically deactivated and no new activities will be available on this account.<br/><br/>If you have not received a new activity for more than 2 days and you are not being prompted to update nor are you using a new device, please contact us and we will investigate and get back to you.</p>
